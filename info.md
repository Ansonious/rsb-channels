:bangbang: **Finding/Hosting a squad:** :bangbang: 

Follow these steps to join squads ASAP!

1. *(optional)* Head to <#729561764940742700> and join one of the currently available recruiting roles.

2. Head to <#729561766874316860> and @mention one (or more) of the recruiting roles, or just wait for someone else to do the same (you will get a notification when this happens).
For example: `Hosting @Ult, need 3 more.`
Note that **hosting a squad doesn't mean that you need to lead it or that you need any kind of experience**. Whoever invites people to the in-game lobby is the host.

3. Once there is enough of you to start a group, simply join an open channel (*avoid joining a channel before the host has advertised it in <#729561766874316860>*) or create a temporary channel and set up in there.

4. If you would like to stop getting notifications, head back to <#729561764940742700> and leave the role(s) that you joined. Feel free to keep the role if you want to always be notified. They are used for notification purposes only.

:bangbang: **Temporary channels:** :bangbang: 

Anyone can create temporary channel simply typing in #botspam one of those commands:
`/create chat`
`/create squad`

Once you created the channel, you can rename it and set a user limit by clicking the gear wheel to the right of the name, or right click -> ‘Edit Channel’.

If you want to create a locked channel, just type `--locked` after the command, then proceed to invite other users with `/invite @UserA#1234, @UserB#4321`, etc…

You can also force members to use push-to-talk in the channel by typing `/create chat --ptt` or single users by typing `/invite @UserA#1234 --ptt`.
