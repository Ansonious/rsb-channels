:bangbang: **About** :bangbang:

We are a friendly community that aims to get newcomers into raiding. This involves providing structured guidance (School Buses) and a low pressure environment. Regardless of experience, everyone should be able to find a group.
Enjoy and have fun!

:bangbang: **Finding/Hosting a squad:** :bangbang: 

Follow these steps to join squads ASAP!

1.*(optional)* Head to #botspam and join one of the available recruiting roles: ``Bounties`` ``EidolonHunt`` ``EndoFarm`` ``Fissures`` ``KuvaFarm`` ``NanosporesFarm`` ``PolyFarm`` ``Sorties`` ``Vaultfarm`` ``XpFarm`` ``ZephyrPAFarm`` ``ZephyrPARelicFarm`` 

2. Head to #recruitment and @mention one (or more) of the recruiting roles, or just wait for someone else to do the same (you will get a notification when this happens).
For example: `Hosting @Sorties, need 3 more.`
Note that **hosting a squad doesn't mean that you need to lead it or that you need any kind of experience**. Whoever invites people to the in-game lobby is the host.

3. Once there is enough of you to start a group, simply join an open channel (*avoid joining a channel before the host has advertised it in #recruitment*) or create a temporary channel and set up in there.

4. If you would like to stop getting notifications, head back to #botspam and leave the rank(s) that you joined. Feel free to just keep the rank if you want to always be notified. They are used for notification purposes only.


:bangbang: **Temporary channels:** :bangbang: 

Anyone can create temporary channel simply typing in #botspam one of those commands:
`/create chat`
`/create squad`
Once you created the channel, you can rename it and set a user limit by clicking the gear wheel to the right of the name, or right click -> ‘Edit Channel’.
If you want to create a locked channel, just type `--locked` after the command, then proceed to invite other users with `/invite @UserA#1234, @UserB#4321`, etc…
You can also force push-to-talk the channel by typing `/create chat --ptt` or single users by typing `/invite @UserA#1234 --ptt`.

:bangbang: **Roles:** :bangbang: 

`Moderator / Server Staff`: The Moderators and administrative staff of the server.
`Teacher`: Experienced players that can give instructional knowledge and directions to newer players in the Warframe community.
Read more and apply here: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tYz9ci2tVR82xfXm0xqKp3un5JUgCuLBiPazgktedwg/view>

Some of the roles are there for notification purposes only. For example:
`@Host`: this role can be mentioned in #recruitment and #poe-recruitment 
`@Sorties`
`@XpFarm`

You can join and leave some of those roles at any time by typing `/rank join <rolename>` and `/rank leave <rolename>` in #botspam.
You can type `/rank list` to see all the roles you can join.
Alternatively, use `/add <rank>` or `/remove <rank>` to achieve the same effect, in case one of the bots is down.

:exclamation:  **Do you want to invite someone else to the server?** :exclamation: 

There's a number of ways you can do that. 
1.) Ask them to google 'Raid School Bus' or do it yourself, it will take you to our forum post that has a permanent invite link. 
2.) Give them the permanent invite link yourself: https://discord.gg/wfrsb
3.) Generate your own (temporary) link by hovering your mouse over #rules and clicking on the little box

:bangbang: **Consider this section now undergoing remodeling** :bangbang: 

Raids have now been removed from the game and, as such, you may disregard most of the information in this channel. The server as a whole will be undergoing a long period of drastic changes. Please have patience as this will take a lot of time and effort.

---

Currently in the process of rewording and editing all of this in a new channel, however, some info from here has been removed as it is now completely irrelevant. Some of the information here may be incorrect or outdated, so don't rely on it too much.
