:bangbang: **Finding/Hosting a squad:** :bangbang: 

Follow these steps to join squads ASAP!

**Hosting**

1. Head to <#729561766874316860> use matoi bot and @mention one (or more) of the recruiting roles
For example: `>host ["Name of quest"] [number of people you need] [difficulty] [time]"`
You, the host, can cancel the party by clicking on the :negative_squared_cross_mark: reaction.

2. Once there is enough of you to start a group, you can join an open channel (*avoid joining a channel before the host has advertised it in <#729561766874316860>*) or create a temporary channel and set up in there.

**Joining**
1. *(optional)* Head to <#729561764940742700> and join one of the currently available recruiting roles.

2. Head to <#729561766874316860> and click on the :crossed_swords: to confirm your participation.

4. If you would like to stop getting notifications, head back to <#729561764940742700> and leave the role(s) that you joined. Feel free to keep the role if you want to always be notified. They are used for notification purposes only.

**Recruitment Etiquette**

-Discord is NOT a requirement to form MPA or other parties, its merely the choice of the host and their leads.

-Always set the password to wars and have a distinct Multi Party name.

-If using discord, at least host 30 to 20 minutes before the uq so that people don't panic.

-When you reserve a slot, ensure you don't show up late, if you don't arrive by the time 5 minutes are left before the uq starts, the host/lead has the right to choose someone else to replace you.

-Communicate! Don't just stand around and wait to get invited, let people know you're available.

**Note** In the case of MP(Multi Party) related content such as UQ's(Urgent Quests), the parties are organized as Party A through Z. E.G. MPA will have Party ABC, MPB will have DEF. The main host(In Party A) will be responsible for clearly deciding on who are leads for BCDEF.

:bangbang: **Temporary channels:** :bangbang: 

Anyone can create temporary channel simply typing in #botspam one of those commands:
`/create chat`
`/create squad`

Once you created the channel, you can rename it and set a user limit by clicking the gear wheel to the right of the name, or right click -> ‘Edit Channel’.

If you want to create a locked channel, just type `--locked` after the command, then proceed to invite other users with `/invite @UserA#1234, @UserB#4321`, etc…

You can also force members to use push-to-talk in the channel by typing `/create chat --ptt` or single users by typing `/invite @UserA#1234 --ptt`.

:bangbang: **Roles:** :bangbang: 

Head on over to <#729561764940742700> and choose which roles you want so you can be pinged for specific quests in <#742493068652970104>

:exclamation:  **Do you want to invite someone else to the server?** :exclamation: 

There are two primary ways that you can do that:

1.) Give them the permanent invite link yourself: https://discord.gg/ePSZqA4

2.) Generate your own (temporary) link by right clicking on the server icon and choosing invite people.
