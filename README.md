## Editing text channels

Open and edit the .md file for the channel you want to edit

The file gets split into seperate messages by the `---`  
Each section gets trimmed of any blank rows in the beginning and end of the section (message).  
Sections starting with `![` will be treated as an image only message (first image will be used, rest of section discarded).  

## Editing roles channels

First click on the roles.json file  
You will be directed to the edit page where you are able to add, delete, edit the file.

 Here's what you need to know to properly do those things, we will be looking at this snip as an example
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

You should see something like this, ![Roles snip](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/465059517550428173/549808419251421184/unknown.png)

To add a role, you will be using this format.
###      {
###         "comment": "",
###         "id": "",
###         "emoji": "",
###         "desc": ""
###       }

after filling it out, it should look something like this
###      {
###        "comment": "Test",
###        "id": "373982567600488459",
###        "emoji": "<:test:549809152818675753>",
###        "desc": "Example"
###      }

Comment is well, a comment so that the other mods know what the role being added is.

ID is the role itself, you can find the role id by simply saying "/roleinfo @role"

Emoji is found by putting a \ before the emote.

Desc is just a description for roles that aren't self explanatory.

When adding a few lines for the role, make sure to add in a comma on the role above.
