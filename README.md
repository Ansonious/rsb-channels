## Editing text channels

Open and edit the .md file for the channel you want to edit

The file gets split into seperate messages by the `---`  
Each section gets trimmed of any blank rows in the beginning and end of the section (message).  
Sections starting with `![` will be treated as an image only message (first image will be used, rest of section discarded).  

## Editing roles channels

First click on the roles.json file  
You will be directed to the edit page where you are able to add, delete, edit the file.
