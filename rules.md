**We are a PC community**

:bangbang: **Server Rules** :bangbang:

:one: **Nicknames**
All names must be legible and pronounceable.
No questionable avatars, usernames or nicknames. This includes, but is not limited to, political figures and NSFW symbol/names.

:two: **Don’t be a dick** (Bannable offence)
It’s clear what kind of infractions this covers. Disrespectful and poor behaviour will result in our moderators dispensing mutes, warnings and bans. We will quote this rule when doing so.
:two:. 1

:three: **Topics of politics, religion, NSFW and spam are not tolerated. If you’re not sure if something breaks this rule, just don’t post it.**
This includes references to said politics
Take it into DMs if you insist.

:four: **Respect our team**
We work hard to ensure that everyone is provided with a suitable environment in our server. Please do not ping the team unnecessarily, and especially not as a joke.

:five: **Do not discriminate against newcomers in-game  or on Discord.**
---

:six: **Voice Channel naming conventions**
When renaming your temporary channels (see #info on how to create one, after you read **everything** in this channel) make sure to include the channel topic in the title: `Raid`, `Speedrun`, `Bus`, `Chat` (or mission type, for example “Sorties”, “Fissures”, “XP farm”, etc).

:seven: **Use appropriate text channels**
Check the description of a channel and pinned messages to find out what topic it covers.
If your conversation starts drifting too far off topic for too long, you should consider switching channels.

:eight: **You can only get warned two times *at most* - the next offense results in an immediate ban.**

:nine: **Follow server etiquette** (see below).
---

:bangbang: **Etiquette** :bangbang:

**NOT OK**

:x: Asking for a certain MR or proficiency when recruiting **IS NOT OK**.

:x: Using glitches or skips after the host or group has forbidden it **IS NOT OK**.

:x: Not cooperating with your host or group **IS NOT OK**.

:x: Joining an Eidolon Hunt without having at least a Mote Amp **IS NOT OK**. 

**IS OK**

:white_check_mark: Reserving 1 spot in the group for veterans **IS OK**, it helps ensure a smooth run.

:white_check_mark: Setting gear requirements for your squad **IS OK BUT ONLY IF IT’S REASONABLE** E.G. Rejecting a player because they only have a rank 21 Mag is fine; but rejecting someone because they don’t have Primed Flow is **NOT**

:white_check_mark: Rejecting a player for personal issues **IS OK, BUT** keep any resulting drama in PMs

:white_check_mark: It is very helpful to PM the host in-game so he can invite you via right click. Type `/w host_IGN hello` in the in-game chat.

:white_check_mark: It is ok to use `@recruitment` tags as much as you want when hosting or looking for a group. However, please avoid spamming.
