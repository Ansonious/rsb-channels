**What are the changes?**

Two changes. There will be a branch group being made specifically for Geared. This branch group is meant for higher level impromptu runs. The second is the push for discord activity. Using Matoi bot and the entire server in general


**How do these new changes affect the main group?**

The new changes will NOT affect the main group drastically, It will still be the same place where you can still socialize and form parties with people within the group.


**Does this mean I can’t play with the people I used to before?**

You still can! The main group chat will stay intact, we are NOT booting anyone out. People who qualify for geared just get invited to the branch group that’s strictly for forming impromptu runs only.

**Will everyone leave me and talk in the branch group like it’s the new main group?**

Of course not! 

The branch group was made specifically for people who meet the requirements for geared and wish to form parties with people who are also qualified for geared. The branch group is first and foremost for forming parties, not socializing.


**Why are you doing this?**

The original intention of the group chat was made for people who wanted to run with organized and decently geared players. Down the line we wanted to be more open and help new players out with the intention that they would gain experience and grow. However as time passed, we were hit with a new influx of players and hosting urgent quests became a lot more complicated to the point where it was chaotic. This opened up the option of using discord to organize groups.


**Why was the decision to make a separate group made?**

Due to recent events with people being unhappy how disorganized urgent quests/ultimates were and a considerable amount of people in the group were undergeared, which made people put in more effort than necessary.

**What were other options explored before creating said group?**

-Separate server (Not the route intended for expansion), 
-Dming each and every single person for higher tier runs (This was done in the very beginning before the group was formed. Not realistic scaled), 
-Normal/Geared roles (Undergeared still appeared to these runs), 
-Using upper levels of the Cafe for Geared (This was for planned runs, not impromptu). 
-Affixing Event (Had some reception, but only so much to the point where it was understood there are those here for the social part of the game.)
-Checking gear in Normal runs, offering to help in affixing.(Too many variables to list)


**How will forming parties work now?**

Parties will be formed in discord for better organization and less confusion with the use of Matoi-Chan

**Who is Matoi-Chan?**

A discord bot in our server, she’ll primarily be used for making parties but can do other commands such as looking up stats of weapons, translating JP terms to NA and etc. For more information on how Matoi-Chan works, take a look at the pins in the botspam channel.

**How do I get into Normal?**

Check the #resources and #info channel for more information.
Apply through a form in #info. You must meet the minimal affixing requirements


**How do I get into Geared?**


Geared is achieved by getting 2 vouches by a Mentor in terms of affixing and skill


**How do I get into Mentor?**

Mentors are attained by 2 vouches, 1 from a mentor, 1 from a mod. Mentors have a much more strict requirements due to the fact that they are teachers for PSO2


**Affixing is too hard, Normal requirements are too high a barrier for me!**


Go to a mentor for lessons! They have that very role because they want to help you.


**What is a Mentor?**

Mentors teach players Affixing, Class Specific, Optimal rotations, and General game knowledge. Approach Mentors if you want to learn and get into Geared.
