:bangbang: **Server Rules** :bangbang:

:one: **Nicknames/Avatars**
All names must be readable and pronounceable.
No questionable avatars, usernames or nicknames. This includes but is not limited to political characters, NSFW symbol/names and anything deemed unfit by the moderation team. Including your IGN in your discord nickname is recommended, either in brackets (parenthesis) or your IGN as it is.

:two: **Don’t be a dick** (Bannable offence)
It’s clear what kind of infractions this covers. Disrespectful and poor behaviour will result in our moderators dispensing mutes, warnings and bans. We will quote this rule when doing so.

:three: **Topics of religion, NSFW and spam are not tolerated. If you’re not sure if something breaks this rule, just don’t post it.**
Take it into DMs if you insist.

:four: **Respect our team**
We work hard to ensure that everyone is provided with a suitable environment in our server. Please do not ping the team unnecessarily, and especially not as a joke.

:five: **Do not discriminate against newcomers in-game  or on Discord.**

---

:six: **Voice Channel naming conventions**
When renaming your temporary channels (see #info on how to create one, after you read **everything** in this channel) make sure to include the channel topic in the title in some form: `MPA`, `Chat` (or mission type, for example “UQ”, “Ult”, “VHAQ”, etc).

:seven: **Use appropriate text channels**
Check the description of a channel and pinned messages to find out what topic it covers.
If your conversation starts drifting too far off topic for too long, you should consider switching channels.

:eight: **You can only get warned two times *at most* - the next offense results in an immediate ban.**
                                    
:nine: **Poaching(stealing) members from other alliances is forbidden and can result in an immediate ban**

:keycap_ten: **Follow server etiquette** (see below).

:bangbang: **Etiquette** :bangbang:

**NOT OK**
:x: Being uncooperative with your host or group **IS NOT OK**.

:x: Autochat to the point where it floods the screen/considered annoying or spammy **IS NOT OK**. 

**IS OK**

:white_check_mark: Setting gear requirements for your squad **IS OK BUT ONLY IF IT’S REASONABLE** E.G. Rejecting a player because they only have a Red Katana for ult is fine; but rejecting someone because they don’t have 75/75 class is **NOT**

:white_check_mark: Rejecting a player for personal issues **IS OK, BUT** keep any resulting drama in PMs

:white_check_mark: It is very helpful to message the host in-game so they can invite you.

:white_check_mark: It is ok to use `@recruitment` tags as much as you want when hosting or looking for a group. However, please avoid spamming.
